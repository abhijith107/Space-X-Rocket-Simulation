# Space-X-Rocket-Simulation
Simulation of a rocket launch and deploy using OPEN GL library in C

# Discription

The model describe the trajectory and  properties of a rocket during the entry into the earths atmosphere. When the final capsule reached the orbiting location the last part is also disconnected and the satellite is placed in orbit. The motion of the  detached tanks also follow the zero gravity property of the space.

# Applications

-> Understanding rocket dynamics.
-> Computing proximity to the equator through simulation
-> Appropriate interpretation of rocket launch
-> Educational purposes
